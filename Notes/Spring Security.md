- **Authentication:** Verifying a user's identity. This typically involves checking a username and password against a data source, but Spring Security supports other methods as well.
- **Authorization:** Determining what a user is allowed to do within the application. This is based on the user's roles and permissions.
- **Protection against common attacks:** Spring Security helps guard your application against vulnerabilities like SQL injection and Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).

Because it integrates well with Spring and is easy to use, Spring Security is the go-to choice for securing Spring applications.
